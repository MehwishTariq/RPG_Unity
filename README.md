My contribution to this project is creating a scene named 'FirstScene' that can be found in:

Assets > Creator kit-RPG > Scenes > FirstScene

The assets used in creating the scene were provided in the folder by the tutorial.

The project folder named "RPG" contains the executable file, the folder can be unzipped anywhere on your computer and you will be able to play the game with the scene I created.

# Controls:

1.  Use "Arrow keys" to move the character on the map.

2.  Use "Left or Right Arrow keys" to select the dialogue when prompted.

3.  Press "Spacebar" to choose the dialogue.
