# RPGkit

This project is a creator kit taken from the unity tutorial named 'Teaching game design and development'. The link to the course is attached below.

My contribution to this project is creating a scene named 'FirstScene' that can be found in:

Assets > Creator kit-RPG > Scenes > FirstScene

The assests used in creating the scene were provided in the folder by the tutorial.

The project folder named "RPG" contains the executable file, the folder can be unzipped anywhere on your computer and you will be able to play the game with the scene I created.
